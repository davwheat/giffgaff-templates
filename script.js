This is another variation of a scam designed to get you to hand over personal and financial details. The scammers fake the Caller ID information to make the message look like they are from any number or name they care to use (usually 443 or GIFFGAFF). By doing so, they can fool many unsuspecting victims into responding, believing the message to be genuine.

For future reference, **all genuine giffgaff URLs will start with either "giffgaff.com" OR "giff.ly"**.

Please do not enter any details and, if you have clicked on the link, follow these steps immediately!

1. Change the password to your giffgaff account - https://www.giffgaff.com/support/lost-password

2. Verify all your account details are correct: https://www.giffgaff.com/profile/details

3. Let giffgaff know about the possible account compromise via the agents on this link so they can advise you on what to do next (and state if you received a text saying a SIM Swap is about to be performed) - https://support2.giffgaff.com/app/ask/Account-misuse-and-security-issues/Account-misuse-and-security-issues/form/

4. Please forward the message you got to 7726 (spells out SPAM). This is completely free to do.

5. If you suspect your bank details may have been compromised as a result, alert your bank as soon as possible.

6. Change passwords/emails on any other accounts outside of giffgaff that might have the same login information.

giffgaff and most UK networks don't plan to implement it soon (for what I know) but you can manually enable it to work via Google's servers instead. The downside is that everyone else also has to enable it and use Google Messages.

1. Download [Google Messages](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging) on your Android phone
3. Open up Google Messages and click through the tutorial, then set it as your default SMS app when it asks

6. Tap 'Phone number' and enter your phone number **with the +44 prefix**
7. Tap the back arrow
5. Tap Chat Features

If that doesn't work, you may have to use a workaround...

1. Download [Activity Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.szalkowski.activitylauncher&hl=en) on your Android phone

4. After the list appears, scroll down to 'Messages' and tap it

Please remember that the examples above arenât an exhaustive list of how you could be breaching our Fair Usage Policy. Other activities which we reasonably believe to be outside of legitimate consumer use may also be subject to the terms in this Fair Usage Policy.
